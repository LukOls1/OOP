# OOP
 Final Junior Programming Test

This project is simple test to implement all OOP pillars:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

In this game there are three figures which are selectable by mouse click. When figure is selected, you can move it with WSAD keys. Each figure moves differently and turn color to red when selected. I used Singleton to keep all important data in one place
